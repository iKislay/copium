"""Copium CLI - Command-line interface for memory and proxy management.

The subcommand submodules are imported eagerly below so they are bound as
attributes of `copium.cli`. Click registration happens via side effects in
`main.py::_register_commands`, but that only binds them to the *main.py*
module. Tests that do `patch("copium.cli.<sub>.<attr>")` resolve the target
by walking attributes on the package object, and that lookup fails when a
prior test has popped `copium.cli` from `sys.modules` and re-imported it
through a path other than `main.py` (e.g. a test that replaces
`sys.modules["copium.cli.main"]` with a fake to isolate one subcommand).
Doing `from . import ...` here means the submodule attribute binding
survives that kind of sys.modules mutation.
